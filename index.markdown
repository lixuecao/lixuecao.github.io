Welcome to our urban environmental monitoring and modeling lab at the China Agricultural University. We focus on using satellite observations and geographical information tools to explore the interactions and inspirations between human and natural system in the urban domain, including urban extent dynamics, land use/cover change modeling, urban vegetation phenology, and integrated assessment models for sustainable development. Our multidisciplinary research spans the fields of remote sensing, GIS, artificial intelligence, climate change, sustainable development, energy consumption, and vegetation ecosystems. 

We are always looking for highly motivated students and postdocs to join our lab. Please contact PI Xuecao Li (xuecaoli@cau.edu.cn) if you are interested.
