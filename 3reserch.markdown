**Mapping global urban extent dynamics**

Using Landsat time series data, we developed a mapping framework to extract annual, high resolution (30m), and temporally consistent global urban extent dynamics dataset GAIA, as well as the multi-temporal global settlement boundary dataset GUB.

**Urban sprawl modeling**

We developed multiple urban cellular automata models, to support studies of urban environmental change under future shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and climate change scenarios.

**Urban vegetation phenology**

We developed a cloud-based mapping framework to generate long-term, high spatial and temporal resolution vegetation phenology datasets in the complicated urban environment. We explored the dynamics of phenological indicators and modeled their responses to the changing urban environment.

**Nighttime light**

We developed a series of products using nighttime light time-series data, including the stepwise calibration of DMSP/OLS data, the harmonization of DMSP/OLI and VIIRS/DNB data, and applications of urban extent mapping and ecological protection.
